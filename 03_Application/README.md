# Application

The application for the actual prediction. It gets bus information from Golemio in realtime, and then uses an ML model to predict arrival times.

# Installation

Install dependencies: `python3`

Install Python modules: `pandas`, `python-dateutil`, `requests`, `scikit-learn`

# Configuration

Once again, you need a [Golemio API Key](https://api.golemio.cz/api-keys/).

Create file `config.json`, with the following format:

```json
{
	"api": {
		"token": "[Golemio API Key]"
	},
	"ml": {
		"model_path": "[Path to model]"
	}
}
```

# Usage

Make sure that `ml.model_path` points to one of the models generated by the trainer.

Just run `main.py`.

# The Process

This is the final step in this whole ordeal. We got a model generated by step two, and then use it to predict bus arrival times at stops.
